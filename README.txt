Introduction
============

A green skin for GroupServer. The ``Products.GSProfile`` product defines
the layout for the GroupServer pages. This skin takes core layout and
adds colour to the items.

Colours
=======

The colours are green, based on a tissue box that Dan likes.

jQuery
======

A snippet of a jQuery.UI module is define here. Most of the module
is defined by the ``gs.content.javascript.jquery`` product. The
``Products.GSProfile`` product defines the CSS layout (using a black and
white colour scheme). This module defiles some *colours* for jQuery.UI.
